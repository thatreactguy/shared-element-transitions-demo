# Shared Element Transitions Demo (using React and Framer Motion)

Shared Element Transitions are a great way of implementing Material motion and adding some flair to your app. Shared element transitions help the user on their journey through your app by giving them a focal point as they go from screen to screen. They can make your app feel whole, rather than a bunch of separate screens slapped together.
